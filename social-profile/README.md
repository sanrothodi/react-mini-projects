# Social profile built with React

Simple social profile built with React

Clone this git repository and run the social profile locally in your machine.


### Open Terminal

> If you don't know how to find it, just click "cmd + spacebar" on your Mac and will open your Spotlight search. Then type Terminal and open it.

### Make sure that you have Node.js and NPM installed in your machine
> To check whether if they are installed or not, you can just check the version number. Run:

    node -v

> Most likely if you have Node.js you'll have NPM, but just to double check you can just check NPM's version number too:

    npm -v

> If your terminal doesn't return a number, you'll have to install them. You can do that by installing Homebrew first, run this on your terminal:

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

> Then run:

    brew install node

> This will automatically install Node.js and NPM in your machine, now you can check the version, to make sure they are installed.

### Navigate to where our project is in our computer

> Run:

    cd static-page

### Start our environment to run the project

> Run:

    npx start

> After this the project will be opened on your web browser and you'll be able to see the static page built with React.
> If your project doesn't open in the browser you can just open your browser and go to where your environment has been set up: http://localhost:3000/
